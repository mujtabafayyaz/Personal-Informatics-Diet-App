# Personal-Informatics-Diet-App

## What is it?
This android app allows users to store data relating to the foods they eat in a day. The app then generates a breakdown of the macro nutrients of their food and keeps a record of this. It also allows the users to enter their personal quantitative goals relating to macronutrients and they can keep track of their daily streaks. The goals section of the app was designed and coded by myself.

## Disclaimer
As this was a group project, I have only included the files that I have worked on which involved programming the backend in Java and designing and coding the front end in XML. This was done using the Android Studio tool. Below is a screenshot which shows the Goals section of the app.
